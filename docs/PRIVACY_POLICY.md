# Privacy Policy for Nomads.Eat

**Last Updated:** 15.06.2025

Welcome to Nomads.Eat ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### Personal Data

-   **Account Information:** When you register for an account, we collect your email address and display name to create and manage your user profile. This information is securely handled by Firebase Authentication.
-   **Subscription Information:** If you subscribe to our premium features, we use a third-party service (RevenueCat) to manage your subscription status. We only receive information about your subscription's state (e.g., active, expired) and the associated entitlement. We **do not** collect or store your payment details, such as credit card numbers. All payments are processed securely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

### App Usage Data

-   **Menu & Image Data:** To provide our core service, we process the images of menus you upload. The text extracted from these images is sent to our cloud-based AI services (such as Google Vertex AI) for dish recognition and translation. The images themselves are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers unless required for a specific processing task, after which they are not permanently stored on our servers.
-   **Technical & Usage Data:** We use Firebase services that may automatically collect standard technical information, including your device type, operating system, and anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the App's performance and user experience. This includes services like Firebase App Check to protect against abuse.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:

-   Create and manage your account.
-   Provide the core functionality of the App, including dish recognition, translation, and image search.
-   Manage your subscription and provide access to premium features.
-   Send you a verification email.
-   Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App.
-   Troubleshoot issues and protect against fraudulent activity.

## 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell or trade your personal information. We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations with the following third-party service providers:

-   **Firebase (a Google service):** We use Firebase for user authentication, cloud functions (for AI processing and search), and analytics.
-   **Google Cloud (Vertex AI, Translation API):** Text extracted from your menu photos is sent to Google's AI services to be processed for dish recognition and translation.
-   **RevenueCat:** We use RevenueCat to process subscription purchases and verify subscription status. They only receive the necessary user identifiers to link a purchase to an account.

These third-party services have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. We encourage you to review them.

## 4. Data Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. We rely on the security of Firebase Authentication for account management and use standard protocols like HTTPS to secure data in transit. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 5. Data Retention

-   **Account Information:** We will retain your account information for as long as your account is active.
-   **Menu Data:** All menu data, including images and recognized dishes, is stored locally on your device and is under your control. You can delete menus at any time from within the app.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices

### Account Information
You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:
-   Logging into your account settings and updating your account.
-   Contacting us using the contact information provided below to request the deletion of your account and associated data.

### Deleting Data
You can delete any menu you have created directly within the app by long-pressing on the menu item in the "History" list. This will permanently remove the menu and all its associated dishes from your device.

## 7. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of our updates.
