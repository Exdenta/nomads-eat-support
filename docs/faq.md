## Getting Started

### Q: What is Nomads Eat?
**A:** Nomads Eat is an app designed to help travelers understand menus in foreign languages. You can take a photo of a menu, and the app will automatically recognize the dishes, translate them into your preferred language, and even will try to find pictures to show you what the food looks like.

### Q: How do I get started?
**A:** It's simple!
1.  **Create an account** using your email or Google account. You'll be asked to verify your email to secure your account.
2.  After logging in, you'll be on the main "History" screen. Tap the **'+' icon** in the top-right corner to create a new, empty menu.
3.  This will take you to the menu screen. Tap the floating **camera icon** in the bottom right to take a picture of a menu or select one from your phone's gallery.
4.  The app will automatically start recognizing and translating the dishes for you!

### Q: Do I need to create an account?
**A:** Yes, an account is required to save your menus and track your usage. You can sign up quickly using your email and a password or by linking your Google account.

## Core Features (How-To)

### Q: How do I scan a new menu?
**A:** From any menu screen, tap the floating **camera icon** in the bottom right. You can either take a new photo with your camera or select one or more images from your gallery. The app will begin processing them immediately.

### Q: How do I change the language of the translations?
**A:** Go to **Settings** (tap the gear icon in the top right of the main screen). Under the "General" section, you can find the **"Translate Dishes To"** option. Select your desired language from the list. The changes will apply the next time you view or refresh a menu.

### Q: The translation is a bit confusing. Can I see the original dish name?
**A:** Absolutely! For every translated dish, the original name is displayed right below it in a lighter color. This allows you to see the official name and easily point it out to your server if needed.

### Q: What languages do you support?
**A:** The app's interface (buttons, settings, etc.) is available in a select number of languages. However, we can translate dishes *from* and *to* a much wider range of languages. You can see the full list of available languages for dish translation in the **Settings** menu.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Q: The app isn't recognizing dishes correctly. What can I do?
**A:** For the best recognition results, please ensure:
*   The menu is in a well-lit area without strong shadows.
*   The photo is clear and not blurry. Try to hold your phone as steady as possible.
*   The photo is taken from directly above, with the text as horizontal as possible.
*   The menu font is a standard print font, not overly stylized or handwritten.

### Q: A translation or ingredient list seems wrong. What should I do?
**A:** Our AI and translation services are powerful tools, but they are not always perfect and can sometimes make mistakes. We always display the original, untranslated dish name below the translation for this reason. You can use the original name to be sure. We are continuously working to improve our AI's accuracy.

### Q: Why are there no images for some dishes?
**A:** The app searches the internet for images based on the dish name. Sometimes, for very unique, regional, or specific dishes, no suitable images can be found. The quality of the image search also depends on having an active internet connection.

### Q: Can I use the app offline?
**A:** You can view menus and dishes that have already been scanned and saved to your device while offline. However, recognizing new dishes from a photo, translating a menu for the first time, and searching for dish images all require an active internet connection to communicate with our AI and cloud services.

## Account & Data

### Q: Is my menu data backed up? Does it sync between my devices?
**A:** All your scanned menus and dish data are stored locally on your device. This data is not automatically backed up to the cloud or synced across different devices.

### Q: How do I delete a menu?
**A:** On the main "History" screen where all your menus are listed, find the menu you want to delete. **Press and hold** on that menu item, and a confirmation dialog will appear asking if you're sure you want to delete it.

### Q: How do I delete my account?
**A:** To request the deletion of your account and all associated data, please contact our support team. You can find a "Contact Us" or "Support" option within the app's Settings menu.
